# JSON-VBAProject

VBA code written with the purpose of parse and query JSON API responses and return values into cells. 



It works with VBA Variants so this version is not for building and/or manipulating a JSON object tree. 


One Public Module that contains some example wrapper UDF with error handling to be used in Excel. 

The three Private Modules are standalone and independent of Excel
